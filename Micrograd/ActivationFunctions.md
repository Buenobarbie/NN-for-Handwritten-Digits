# Activation Functions (Transfer Funcitions)

Defines the output of a neuron given a set of inputs. It decides whether a neuron should be activated or not

> [!NOTE]
> All hidden layers usually use the same activation function. However, the output layer will typically use a different activation function from the hidden layers. The choice depends on the goal or type of prediction made by the model.
